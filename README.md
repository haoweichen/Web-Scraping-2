# Web-Scraping-2

1. Use tweepy streaming to collect at least <strong>100 tweets of your three favorate topics</strong>
2. Find out the count of each topic in your collected tweets and plot the count of each topic in a chart
3. Analyze the text of each tweet (i.e. "text" attribute in a tweet) and count the frequency of each word (or token) in the text of all the tweets you collected. Find out the <strong>top 50 words by their count</strong> and plot these top words (<strong>hint:</strong> you can reuse the count_token function you created in Assignment 1. Just import your solution script to Assignment 1 and invoke the function)

<strong>Requirements:</strong>

Please define a function tweets_analysis as follows:

* Input: <strong>a text file</strong> which stores each collected tweet as a line
* Output: None
* In the body of your function, do the following:
  * Get the <strong>text</strong> of each tweet (i.e. "text" attribute in a tweet) and count the frequency of each word (or token) in the text of all the tweets you collected.
  * Find out the <strong>top 50 words by their count</strong> (<strong>hint:</strong> you can reuse the count_token function you created in Assignment 1. Just import your solution script to Assignment 1 and invoke the function)
  * <strong>Plot these top words</strong> using <strong>matplotlib</strong> package
<strong>Submission Guidelines:</strong>

* Submit a .py file written in Python 2
* If you import your Assignment1 solution here, please also submit your Assignment1 script (also written in Python 2).
* <strong>Plot the chart using matplotlib</strong>, not brunel package because brunel package can only run in Notebook environment
* <strong>Don’t include “import brunel”, “%matplotlib inline”, and any magic functions</strong> in your script, because these functions need Notebook environment to run.
* <strong>Include import statements</strong> and <strong>the main block</strong> in your code to test your function. To test your solution, in a terminal (mac) or command prompt (win), type: “python <your file name>.py”, you should see a plot if your code run successfully.
